			<h1 class="sr-only">About me and this project</h1>
			<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold">Thanks for checking this out!</h2>
			<p class="">
				<br />
				This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7whpQys1iW/?img_index=1"><span>linescapes.drawing's post</span></a> on "How to find time for your
				creative routine." I really loved the idea but I didn't have the skills to do it by hand, but I do have the skills to make a web app soooo here we are.
				<br />
				I've already used other apps to do basically this thing too but I hope this makes the process a lot easier and a bit more fun for you guys.
				<br />
				A little bit for the comp sci nerds hehe. This was built with SvelteKit, Tailwind and Bits-UI for some of the components. It took around a month planning, designing and
				developing it all and it was super fun to get things working right. I wanted to emphasize the user experience, so I conducted some user tests to get their feedback on the
				steps. Making tiny tools is always a blast so I'll definitely be doing more of this when I can.
				<br />
				If you wanna follow my other adventures then you can find me here.
