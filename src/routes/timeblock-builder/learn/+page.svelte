			<p>Todoist provides the simplest definition that suits what it is perfectly.</p>
			<p>"Time blocking is a time management method where you divide your day into blocks of time. Each block is dedicated to a specific task or group of tasks."</p>
			<p>
				It really depends on how granular you want to be. Personally, I love assigning very broad terms to my time blocks. It's cus' I'm not very good at following a schedule
				but if you give me tasks I need to do in a chunk of time then they'll all be complete by the end.
			</p>

			<p>I've seen others who go super deep with it too. Ali Abdaal would have time blocks down to the minute and I can only dream of having that much self-discipline.</p>

			<p>It really depends on you to know how you want to use it, so let me just help you out with these examples.</p>
